# Final-project-sports-analytics_using_POSTGRES_SQL
In this project, I have performed the job of a sports analyst. I used two datasets related to IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket matches. One dataset contains ball-by-ball data and the other contains match-wise data. I imported the datasets into an SQL database and performed various queries to analyze and to extract important insights from this dataset.
